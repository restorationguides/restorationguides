        <h2>📜 The Quest to Contact Me</h2>
        <p>So... you seek an audience with the great Dylan? A noble goal, indeed. But before you can earn this sacred knowledge, you must prove yourself worthy. The path will be treacherous, the riddles unfathomable, and your WiFi... probably unstable.</p>
    
        <h3>⚔️ The Trials You Must Complete:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>🦄 <b>Find the last living unicorn</b> and convince it to let you ride it to the summit of Mount Ethernet.</li>
            <li>🔱 <b>Retrieve the legendary Ethernet Cable of Destiny</b> buried deep beneath the ruins of Windows Vista.</li>
            <li>🐉 <b>Defeat the Firewall Dragon</b> that guards the sacred inbox.</li>
            <li>🎸 <b>Perform "Through the Fire and Flames" on expert mode</b> in Guitar Hero while blindfolded.</li>
            <li>🕊️ <b>Send a carrier pigeon</b> with a handwritten letter encoded in Morse code—but only during a solar eclipse.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>🌀 Alternative Methods (For Mere Mortals)</h3>
        <p>If you lack the courage for the sacred trials above, you may attempt these lesser methods (though success is not guaranteed):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>📧 Whisper your message to the wind and hope it reaches the Gmail gods.</li>
            <li>📱 Send a text, but only if Mercury is in retrograde.</li>
            <li>📦 Leave a package at your doorstep. If I ever become a wandering monk, I might pick it up.</li>
            <li>📢 Try shouting really loud. Maybe, just maybe, I'll hear you.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>🏆 Should You Succeed...</h3>
        <p>If, against all odds, you complete this impossible quest, a portal shall open. Through it, you may glimpse the ultimate reward: a reply from Dylan Worth. But beware! Many have tried, and none have returned... except that one guy, but we don’t talk about him.</p>
    
        <p><b>Good luck, brave traveler. You shall need it. 🏹</b></p>
