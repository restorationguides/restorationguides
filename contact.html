        <h2>📜 The Quest to Contact Me</h2>
        <p>
            So... you seek an audience with the great Dylan? A noble goal, indeed. But before you can 
            earn this sacred knowledge, you must prove yourself worthy. The path will be treacherous, the 
            riddles unfathomable, and your WiFi... probably unstable. 
        </p>

        <h3>⚔️ The Trials You Must Complete:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>🦄 <strong>Find the last living unicorn</strong> and convince it to let you ride it to the summit of Mount Ethernet.</li>
            <li>🔱 <strong>Retrieve the legendary Ethernet Cable of Destiny</strong> buried deep beneath the ruins of Windows Vista.</li>
            <li>🐉 <strong>Defeat the Firewall Dragon</strong> that guards the sacred inbox.</li>
            <li>🎸 <strong>Perform "Through the Fire and Flames" on expert mode</strong> in Guitar Hero while blindfolded.</li>
            <li>🚀 <strong>Send a carrier pigeon</strong> with a handwritten letter encoded in Morse code—but only during a solar eclipse.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>📡 Alternative Methods (For Mere Mortals)</h3>
        <p>If you lack the courage for the sacred trials above, you may attempt these lesser methods (though success is not guaranteed):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>📧 Whisper your message to the wind and hope it reaches the Gmail gods.</li>
            <li>📱 Send a text, but only if Mercury is in retrograde.</li>
            <li>📦 Leave a package at your doorstep. If I ever become a wandering monk, I might pick it up.</li>
            <li>📡 Try shouting really loud. Maybe, just maybe, I'll hear you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🏆 Should You Succeed...</h3>
        <p>If, against all odds, you complete this impossible quest, a portal shall open. 
            Through it, you may glimpse the ultimate reward: a reply from Dylan Worth. But beware! 
            Many have tried, and none have returned... except that one guy, but we don't talk about him.</p>

        <h3>Good luck, brave traveler. You shall need it. 🏹</h3>
